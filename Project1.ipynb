Orion was a giant, a man so strong and proud that he dared to boast he could kill every beast on Earth. The goddess Artemis, protector of the wild, was both impressed and angered by his arrogance. To humble him, she sent a giant scorpion to challenge him. After a fierce battle, both Orion and the scorpion were placed among the stars, forever chasing each other across the night sky. When the scorpion rises, Orion sets, and vice versa—a celestial dance of hunter and prey.\n",

She boasted that she and her daughter, Andromeda, were more beautiful than the sea nymphs, the Nereids. This insult enraged Poseidon, who sent a sea monster to ravage the land. To save their kingdom, Andromeda was chained to a rock as a sacrifice. But the hero Perseus, flying on winged sandals, slew the beast and freed her. Cassiopeia was placed in the sky, but as punishment, she circles the pole star, sometimes upside down, a reminder of pride’s peril.\n",
            "\n",
            "The purple constellation brings to mind **Cepheus**, Cassiopeia’s husband and king, a man torn between duty and fear. He watched helplessly as his daughter was sacrificed, yet he prayed to the gods for mercy. His steadfastness earned him a place in the stars, a guardian watching over his family’s fate.\n",
            "\n",
            "The blue constellation whispers of **Perseus**, the brave son of Zeus, who wielded the reflective shield and the harpe sword. His quest to save Andromeda and his victory over Medusa, whose gaze turned men to stone, are immortalized in the heavens. Perseus rides the sky, a symbol of courage and divine favor.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, the dark blue constellation calls to mind **Andromeda** herself, the princess whose beauty and bravery shine through her trials. Bound and vulnerable, yet saved by love and heroism, she too was placed among the stars, a beacon of hope and resilience.\n",
            "\n",
